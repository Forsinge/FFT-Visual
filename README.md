# FFT-Visual

A small program for visualizing the results of DFT (more presicely FFT). The idea is not very original. I got inspired by 3Blue1Brown's video on the topic. 

To use the program, draw any path in the left part of the window. The program will then recreate the path using epicycles in the right window. For better results try "closing" the path by returning to the starting point.
