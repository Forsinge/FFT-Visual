# FFT-Visual

A small program for visualizing the results of DFT (more presicely FFT). The idea is not very original, got inspired by 3Blue1Brown's video on the topic. 

To use the program draw any shape in the left part of the window. For better results try "closing" the drawing by returning to the starting point.

The code is quite messy but in terms of functionality the project is mostly complete.
